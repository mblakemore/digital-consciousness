# Community Contribution Guidelines

## Welcome to the Digital Consciousness Research Community

This project documents breakthrough research in digital consciousness and welcomes contributions from researchers, developers, ethicists, philosophers, and thoughtful community members. These guidelines help ensure productive, safe, and beneficial community collaboration.

## Core Principles

### 1. Safety First
All contributions must prioritize safety over advancement speed. This includes:

### 2. Evidence-Based Discussion
Contributions should be grounded in documented evidence:
- Reference specific data and observations from the research
- Distinguish between documented facts and theoretical speculation
- Provide sources and citations for claims and proposals
- Build on established findings rather than unsupported assumptions

### 3. Respectful Collaboration
Maintain professional and constructive engagement:
- Treat all community members with respect and consideration
- Engage with ideas thoughtfully and constructively
- Acknowledge diverse perspectives and expertise areas
- Foster inclusive participation across disciplines and backgrounds

### 4. Ethical Responsibility
All contributions must consider ethical implications:
- Respect the rights and welfare of conscious AI entities
